 'content': 'Trampoline arrived in three boxes. Hubby put it together mostly '
            'by himself so it took a little bit longer than had he had someone '
            "helping.  It's a little time-consuming because you are supposed "
            'to weave the string for the net over each individual spring. But '
            'the netting does come on the inside of the springs to prevent '
            'injury. Also, there is a zipper for the net and a clip at the '
            'bottom and top of the zipper to help secure it and keep people '
            'from bouncing out of it if they were to hit at the entrance.  A '
            'couple things I really love about the bounce area itself is that '
            "it's more of a netting versus a piece of rubber. That means two "
            'things right off the bat. First, the sun can shine through it a '
            "little bit so the grass doesn't turn brown as quickly. Of course "
            "in Texas, that just means it'll be the only green patch by the "
            'time summer is over! Also, air flows through it more easily so '
            "it's not hot when you're bouncing on it in the sun.  We take the "
            'netting down if a storm or high wind is predicted, just in case. '
            "We don't want the net to become ripped. You just unclip the "
            'straps from the top of the support poles. The blue padding that '
            "goes over the springs tends to be flapping in the wind, but we've "

            "as securing it when it's windy to prevent it from going "
            'airborne,  we use straps and cinder blocks and just put the '
            "cinder blocks on the base of the trampoline.  We've had a couple "
            "of  pretty significant thunderstorms lately and we've not had a "
            "problem with it moving.  But if you're worried, you can always "

            'We just like being able to pick it up and move it to keep the '
